# PTWS_Scripts
Scripts for inputting info into PTWS

nessuskev.sh takes a Nessus CSV report and spits out all of the CVE data necessary for the Nessus Kev PTWS finding. Outputs a string that can be directly copied and pasted into PTWS.

passlengths.sh takes the password file in plaintext and shows the amount of characters in each password, currently set to 1-20 characters (in line with PTWS).

Example output:

467 passwords that are eight characters.
